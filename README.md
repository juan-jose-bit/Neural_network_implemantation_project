## Implementation of a Deep Neural network.
This repository contains the code, images and the training and testing sets related to the implementation of the DNN

This implementation is tailored towards a supervised learning scenario: classifying images of cats vs non-cats
, each image is an RGB 64x64 pixels, in wich a cat is labeled 1 and a non- cat picture is labeled 0.

### Files
1. dnn-env: folder containing a python env environment and the libraries used to run the jupyter notebook

2. images: folder containing images that are rendered in the jupyter notebook

3. deep_neural_network: jupyter botebook containing the implementation of the algorithm

4. test_catvnoncat.h5: test set of images and labels used to test tge modeld (h5 format)

5. train_catvnoncat.h5: train set of images and labels used to test tge modeld (h5 format)
